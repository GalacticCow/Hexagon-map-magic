# Magical Hex Map

### What is it?

_Magical Hex Map_ is a new project I'm working on.  The goal is to create a website where you can create a map by
editing hexagonal tiles.  This map will be able to be saved on your computer, and you will be able to likewise load
any maps you have created in the past.  The primary use for this is for Dungeons and Dragons DMs, but any content
creator who needs to create a map and mark locations on it can also find use for it.
